🏠 **MAD Project – Electricity Usage Tracker**

This is a mobile application project developed as part of the Mobile Application Development (MAD) course using **Flutter** and **Dart** in **Android Studio**. The main goal of this project is to calculate and estimate the **monthly electricity consumption** and **bill** of a house, while learning multi-screen navigation, Flutter UI components, and basic app logic without using databases.

👨‍💻 **Project Description**

The application tracks monthly electricity usage based on the number of electrical appliances and their usage time. The app includes three main screens, accessible via a bottom navigation bar:

- 🏠 **Home Screen:** Add or delete homes (e.g., *Home-1*).  
- ⚡ **Devices Screen:** Add electrical appliances, enter wattage and daily hours of usage.  
- ⚙️ **Settings Screen:** Adjust the cost per electricity unit (kWh).  

The app automatically calculates the total monthly power consumption and estimated electricity bill using simple formulas and displays the results neatly.

🧩 **Features**

- 3 Screens with Bottom Navigation (Home, Devices, Settings)  
- Add/Delete homes and devices easily  
- Automatic calculation of energy usage and monthly cost  
- Uses Floating Action Buttons, Cards, and Material 3 widgets  
- Clean teal-green interface  
- Beginner-friendly (no database or API required)

🧮 **Electricity Calculation Formula**

kWh per month = (Watts × Hours per day × 30) / 1000
Monthly Bill = kWh per month × Rate per unit
(Default rate = Rs. 30 per kWh)
